I’m Prigozhaya Lizaveta Konstantinovna, 22 years old and I'm a junior frontend developer. (yea welcome to the club)

I was born in Gomel and graduated from art school, model school, music school, and also the Gomel city lyceum 
in physics and mathematics. 
Yes, I had a hardworking childhood, and I know how tilt and patience feels like. That's why I chose IT engineering field. 
After that I Graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, also I have a certificate 
of courses at the IT Academy in web and mobile design, and I’m currently attending the RSSchool frontend course. 

I’m persistent in my work tasks, and I’m always trying to finalize them in full, every time I do my best. 
So I use my analytical brain and scrupulously understand assignments as well.  I have to fill my brain with some new useful knowledge in IT.

Regarding my passion for programming, Yes, its like a poison. For example the last project minesweeper. 
At first you don’t know how to start, but then you remember how to play the game, understand the logic and structure of code  and just begin coding….
After the first written function, your hands begin to code by themselves. when you came around you have already played 20 games of your own project. 
I think this is one of the main reasons why I like the frontend is that I can see the result of my work immediately. 
Thus, I strive to make the web more user-friendly, optimized and beautiful in terms of design and functionality. 

Thank you for your attention. You can find some links in the description.
